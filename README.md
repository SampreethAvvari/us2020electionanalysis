## Abstract
This research evaluates political sentiment analysis to reveal trends in digital discourse during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections. Utilizing advanced AI models like Few-shot Llama 3 and RoBERTa, we analyzed millions of tweets to detect fake news, classify sentiment, and identify key topics. This study aims to understand the polarized emotions and attitudes prevalent during the elections and assess Twitterâ€™s content moderation for potential partisan bias.

## Introduction
The influence of social media on political discourse is significant, especially during events like the U.S. presidential elections. Our study leverages social media data to provide direct insights into public sentiment, where users express support or disdain for candidates. By categorizing tweets and analyzing sentiment, we explore the nature of political emotions during the election season.

## Key Objectives
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning the Few-shot Llama 3 model for detecting fake news in U.S. elections.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Using RoBERTa to classify tweets by sentiment into pro or anti-candidate categories.
- **Topics Modeling**: Examining election season topics and their variations with sentiment changes.
- **Misinformation Mapping**: Measuring fake news spread across states and assessing geographical and temporal trends.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Studying regional sentiment distribution to gauge localized political engagement.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Exploring user patterns in political support, focusing on antagonistic versus supportive expressions in misinformation-laden tweets.

## Methodology
The methodology includes fine-tuning AI models for enhanced detection of misinformation and classifying tweets based on sentiment. We also performed topic modeling to infer the discussion themes across different political leanings.

## Datasets
1. **LIAR Dataset**: Used for training our model to detect fake news.
2. **US 2020 Election Tweets Dataset**: Compiled to analyze public sentiment on Twitter for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.

## Models Used
- **Fake News Detection**: Employing the fine-tuned LLAMA-3 8B model.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing the RoBERTa-base sentiment analysis model trained on a large corpus of tweets.
- **Topic Modeling**: Applying LDA for generative statistical modeling to uncover latent topics in tweets.

## Results
The analysis shows a significant presence of both fake and negative news about candidates, with notable differences in tweet volume between candidates. Our findings highlight the role of misinformation and sentiment in shaping public discourse during the elections.

## Conclusion
The study reveals complex interactions among user behavior, misinformation spread, and regional demographics that influenced the political discourse on Twitter, highlighting the need for improved data analysis methods across different social media platforms.
